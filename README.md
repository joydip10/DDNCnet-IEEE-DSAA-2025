## Repository Structure

### 1. `Parallelization and Network Analysis/`

This directory includes core components for network construction and stock selection:

- **GPU-Enhanced DDNCnet**  
  Implementation of the Dynamic Data-Driven Correlation Network (DDNCnet) using GPU acceleration for high-performance financial time-series network analysis.

- **GPU-Enhanced Linear Correlation-Based Financial Network**  
  Constructs financial stock networks based on linear correlation coefficients with GPU parallelization to improve computation speed.

- **Stock Selection via Machine Learning and Network-Based Community Detection**  
  Code for identifying promising stocks using supervised machine learning models informed by network-derived community structures.

### 2. `Data-driven Portfolio Optimization/`

This directory contains year-wise results from portfolio optimization based on clustering and network community analysis:

- **Subfolders by Year**  
  Each subfolder corresponds to a particular year of financial data analysis.

- **Clustering and Community Detection Outputs**  
  Selected stock sets are derived from applying clustering algorithms and network-based community detection methods.

- **Network Variants**  
  Results are provided for both GPU-enhanced DDNCnet and linear correlation-based network approaches.
